### Concatenating vectors

I need to concatenate two PETSc vector arrays in such a way that I can easily pull them apart.
I need to be able to put the concatenated vector into a PETSc solver.

There seems to be a deprecated method `PETSc.Vec.concatenate()` which would have done exactly as I needed.
Now I'm hoping that functionality has been moved to `PETSc.Vec().createNest()`.

I can nest vectors with:
```python
vecs = PETSc.Vec().createNest([u.x.petsc_vec,v.x.petsc_vec])
```
If I want to extract vectors from the nest, I do:
```python
u_out, v_out = vecs.getNestSubVecs()
```

### Custom line search

I need to be able to switch between MSPIN and AltMin based on the residual.
This will require a custom line search, since this will take advantage of the implicit fixed point iteration,
which is not common for SNES problems.

Might be an idea to adapt Powell's dogleg method, which chooses a step optimized along a line between two vectors.
Those two vectors would be the step from the fixed point iteration and the Newton step.
