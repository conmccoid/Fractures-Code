### Concatenating vectors

I need to concatenate two PETSc vector arrays in such a way that I can easily pull them apart.
I need to be able to put the concatenated vector into a PETSc solver.

There seems to be a deprecated method `PETSc.Vec.concatenate()` which would have done exactly as I needed.
Now I'm hoping that functionality has been moved to `PETSc.Vec().createNest()`.

I can nest vectors with:
```python
vecs = PETSc.Vec().createNest([u.x.petsc_vec,v.x.petsc_vec])
```
If I want to extract vectors from the nest, I do:
```python
u_out, v_out = vecs.getNestSubVecs()
```
